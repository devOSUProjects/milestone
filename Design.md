## 1. Introduction
- What is the name of your language?
- What is the language’s paradigm?
- (Optional) Is there anything especially unique/interesting about your language that you want to highlight up front?

## 2. Design
-  What features does your language include? Be clear about how you satisfied the constraints of the feature menu.
-  What level does each feature fall under (core, sugar, or library), and how did you determine this?
-  What are the safety properties of your language? If you implemented a static type system, describe it here. Otherwise, describe what kinds of errors can occur in your language and how you handle them.

## 3. Implementation
- What semantic domains did you choose for your language? How did you decide on these?
- Are there any unique/interesting aspects of your implementation you’d like to describe?
